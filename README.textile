h1. VeloStar

This repository regroups various scripts that would make use
of the data provided by "Keolis Rennes":http://data.keolis-rennes.com regarding
transportation in the city of Rennes, France.


h2. bin/fetch_and_update.rb

This script builds statistics of the Velo Star network using RRD. It
fetches remote information from the Keolis API, eventually creates RRD
files if needed and update those with current data (number of
available bikes and slots)

h2. bin/place_stations.rb

This scripts creates images displaying the status of the VéloStar
stations. It uses different map images as background overlay. It makes
use of the existing RRD files and creates an image for each period
that can be fetched, allowing one to use those images to build an
animation. For example:

 * "Simple background":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L5RELeFO9A
 * "HD resolution":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5ytqWZgSa0
